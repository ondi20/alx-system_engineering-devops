#Networking Basics
Objectives:
OSI Model:
    What it is: The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.
    How many layers it has: It has seven layers.
  
    How it is organized: The layers, from the bottom to the top, are Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

LAN (Local Area Network):
    What it is: A LAN is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or campus.
  
    Typical usage: LANs are used for local communication and resource sharing among connected devices.
  
    Typical geographical size: Typically covers a small geographical area, like a single building or a campus.

WAN (Wide Area Network):
    What it is: A WAN is a network that covers a broad area and often connects multiple LANs.
  
    Typical usage: WANs are used for long-distance communication and connecting geographically dispersed networks.
  
    Typical geographical size: Spans a large geographical area, like a city, country, or even global networks.

Internet:
    What it is: The Internet is a global network of interconnected networks that use the Internet Protocol Suite to communicate.

IP Address:
    What it is: An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

    Types of IP addresses: There are two types: IPv4 (32-bit address) and IPv6 (128-bit address).

localhost:
    What it is:localhost refers to the current device used to access it. It is often used for testing and debugging.

Subnet:
    What it is: A subnet is a portion of a network that shares a particular address space.

**IPv6 Creation:**
- **Why IPv6 was created:** IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses due to the increasing number of devices connected to the internet.

**TCP/UDP:**
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication.
  
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** Provides connectionless, unreliable communication.

**Data Transfer Protocols:**
- **Mainly used protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

**Difference between TCP and UDP:**
- **Main difference:** TCP is connection-oriented and ensures reliable data delivery, while UDP is connectionless and provides faster but less reliable data transfer.

Port:
    What it is: A port is a communication endpoint in an operating system.

Port Numbers:
    SSH: Port 22
    HTTP: Port 80
    HTTPS: Port 443

Network Connectivity Check:
    Tool/protocol: Ping is often used to check if a device is connected to a network.
