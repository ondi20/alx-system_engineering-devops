HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is an extension of HTTP, the protocol used for communication on the internet, but with an added layer of security provided by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). 

HTTPS ensures that the data exchanged between a user's web browser and the website they are visiting is encrypted, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and manipulate the data. This encryption helps protect sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, and personal details.

When a website is accessed via HTTPS, the data is encrypted using an SSL/TLS certificate. This certificate verifies the identity of the website and establishes a secure connection between the user's browser and the website's server.
